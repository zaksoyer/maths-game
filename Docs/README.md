# Maths Game (Unamed game yet.. sort of)
## The Docs

### Main objective

* Practice maths mental aritmethic and problem resolution.
* Show maths are used in everything of our simple or complex life.

**more..**

The basic of this game is to answer maths problems as quick it's humanly possible.
Starting with mental arithmetic, problem resolution will follow.

### Second objective

The second objective of this game is to educate on a personal interest.

I would like to develop this game with an egine on which you can add skins with different interests : cooking, electricity, management, fireman, history, etc..

The data stored on the web make it easy to update/correct any information instantly.
The database engine is to be determinated.. but Fireabse looks the one..

This is the first game I'm creating.  I want eventually my game to become an app and, for now, I can't develop an app (Rick would be pleased to leave me alone with Glootie..) I'm working on upgrading my 6 GiGs of RAM to 16 so being able to run the development tools.  Meanwhile, I'm working on the generators and a basic web interface (no skin) to make the game works.

### Philosopy

You can't really lose at this game.  Other then quit and reset your game, it's always possible ton continue further by doing a test correctly.

### Rules

* Each round is presented like a tests, maximum 6 questions for beginners, 12 questions for intermediates and 15 for advanced level.
* To complete a round, the player must solve 5, 10 or 12 (depending on the difficulty level) maths operations correctly.
* A time limit can be assigned.
* In the case of no time limit assigned, 
* Beginners : player has 3 seconds to select the answer.
* Intermediates : player has 3 seconds to answer, time is cumulative until the end of the round
* Advanced : player has 2.5 seconds to answer, time is cumulative until the end of the round.  

For both : intermediate and advanced, in case of a wrong answer the time left WON'T be cumulated.

### Features
* Build a file with stats
* Send results to a registered mentor/teacher
* Groups in which admins can create special tests for specific player
