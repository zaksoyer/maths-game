# MathEngine

It contains all instructions, functions and subroutines to handle maths.

* Generates all maths tables needed for the game
* Generates all round's tests
* Load maths problems
* Validate an answer\*

\*The function to validate answers should only be accessible when using the engine directly to avoid flooding on the APi.  Since teh mouse is ow acting 98% of the time, there're a lots of possibilities to handle a good answer without validating from the math tables or a function.

A certain amount of _CONSTANTS are initialized.  They are expected to be replaced with injected(??) values.
